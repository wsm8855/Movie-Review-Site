# Movie-Review-Site
Repository for the Django project used to deploy my implementation of a text sentiment analyzer trained on movie reviews.

Link to deployed Heroku app: https://protected-garden-36914.herokuapp.com/ (may take a few seconds for heroku server to respond upon initial request)

The lack of developement commits from earlier in the process is because the contents of this repository needed to be moved from the original repo on my RIT CS Github account. The process could not be a simple ownership transfer because of security problems that would be caused by making the original repo and commit history public.
